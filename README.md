# 🐾 Cozy Cat for SillyTavern

**Cozy Cat** is a SillyTavern extension that adds an immersive, interactive pet cat companion to your roleplay chats. It tracks your kitten's age, status (hunger, happiness, hygiene, energy), and displays a beautiful overlay UI inspired by cozy mobile apps.

> **Note:** This extension is designed to work with specific a character card and Lorebooks that output data in a format the extension can read, which is "Your Pet Cat."
